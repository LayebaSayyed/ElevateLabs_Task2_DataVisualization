# ElevateLabs_Task2_DataVisualization
This repository contains my Task 2 submission for the Elevate Labs Data Analyst Internship, where I used Power BI to create visualizations and dashboards based on the Superstore dataset. It includes all charts, screenshots, and the final PDF report demonstrating data storytelling and key business insights.
